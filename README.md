# ðŸ§ª Sorting Breakout: Quick Sort vs Merge Sort

Welcome to your first *sorting algorithm performance lab*! In this
exercise, youâ€™ll compare **Quick Sort** and **Merge Sort** across
different types of input.

## ðŸ§  Goals

- Understand algorithm behavior on different inputs
- Measure **execution time** and **memory usage**
- Recognize tradeoffs: speed vs memory, best vs worst case

## ðŸ§° Files

- `sort_utils.py`: Functions for Quick Sort and Merge Sort
- `timing_experiment.py`: CLI script to run sort comparisons
-  First run the timing experiment by typing ```python -m timing experiment``` at the terminal (leave off the .py). Then play with the inputs and observe the results. Were they what you expected? Why?
